# Hub

This is a monorepo of different services used around my house.

## Workflow

This assumes you Docker installed on your machine.

### Development

1. `cd` to a service you want to edit.
2. run `docker-compose up -d` to deploy a development session to localhost
3. Make your changes

### Production

1. run `docker-compose up -d` in the root folder
